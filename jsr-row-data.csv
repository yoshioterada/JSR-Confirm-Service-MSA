Possible technologies for inclusion include programmable shading and advanced rendering techniques.,Withdrawn,The changes to the Java 3D API as originally envisioned by JSR-189 were quite significant and were planned as part of a major API release for which we had planned to form an expert group under the JSR. Due to changes in the nature of the project development this effort was discontinued in 2002 a few months after the JSR was filed. JSR-189 was left open as a place-holder but it no longer makes sense to leave it open. At the time of withdrawal the Java 3D API was a community source project on java.net where all new development had happened over the past 18 months. They were actively developing the 1.4 API release with help from the Java 3D community on java.net. This release was a much more modest undertaking than was originally planned and all new API changes are being designed with public input.
